# chuck-norris-facts-api
A sample REST api using the FastApi framework, exposing some Chuck Norris facts, deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

This project is the first of three sessions, part of the 9 hours module *Machine Learning: from idea to product* 
of the Post Masters degree [Big Data And Analytics](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/post-masters-degree/all-post-masters-degree/post-masters-degree-in-big-data) from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home).

### Project description
Here, we propose to build a demo RESTful api in Python, using the framework FastApi. We will cover topics like:
- Setting up the python development environment with virtualenv
- Dockerizing the project from the beginning
- Coding model classes with (included in FastApi)
- Making a data access layer to a fake database
- Implementing GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE endpoints with FastApi to interact with this database.
- Deploy the project manually on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
- Setup the continuous deployment using [Circle CI](https://circleci.com)

All resources are located in the [resources](resources) folder.
